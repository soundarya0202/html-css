        <p>A laptop (also laptop computer), often called a notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a "clamshell" form factor, typically having a thin LCD or LED computer screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid of the clamshell and
            an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside of the lower lid. The clamshell is opened up to use the computer. Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.Its name comes from lap, as it was deemed to be placed
            on a person's lap when being used
        </p>
        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>As the personal computer (PC) became feasible in 1971, the idea of a portable personal computer soon followed. A "personal, portable information manipulator" was imagined by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC in 1968,[5] and described in his 1972 paper as
            the "Dynabook".[6] The IBM Special Computer APL Machine Portable (SCAMP) was demonstrated in 1973. This prototype was based on the The IBM 5100, the first commercially available portable computer, appeared in September 1975, and was based
            on the SCAMP prototype.

        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
            The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two officers have been conferred
            with the rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial position of great honor. The Indian Army originated from the armies of the East India Company, which eventually became the British Indian Army, and the armies of the princely
            states, which finally became the national army after independence. The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in several battles and campaigns across the world, earning many battle and theatre honours
            before and after Independence.
        </p>
